            Its not by fate that I am beautful🥰 <br>
            I was born in the month of beauty🥰 <br>
            I express beauty independent and unconventional <br>
            to the standard of this life🥰 <br>
            Some call me an angel <br>
            but nothing is angelic about being realistic🥰 <br>
            If unaware my likes are insightful <br>
            deal on your behalf <br>
            like air to everyone🥰 <br>
            My intellect is a path<br>
            to the lost souls <br>
            no matter how oblivion🥰 <br>
            My touch is remarkable <br>
            a blessing from nature they say 🥰<br>
            Like damn! It is <br>
            🥰🥰🥰
